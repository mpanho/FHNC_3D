# FHNC_3D
A simple FHNC module in python3

The program uses numpy and scipy

The FHNC method, as described in .., has been implemented as python module, which can be invoked wherever needed.
To see how it is used run the simple user interface in the comand line:
$ python3 test.py

The rest should be selfexplaning.
