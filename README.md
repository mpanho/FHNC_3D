# FHNC_3D
A simple FHNC module in python3

The program uses numpy 1.12

The FHNC method, as described in	arXiv:1807.04549, has been implemented as python module, which can be invoked wherever needed.
To see how it is used run the simple user interface in the comand line:
$ python3 test.py

The rest should be selfexplaning.
